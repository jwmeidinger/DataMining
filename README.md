##UFC Correlations  
Jordan Meidinger  Jayden Rosenau

Using the database provided by Kaggle which includes fights from 1993 to 2019 with 5,144 matches and 44+ columns such as height, reach distance, number of strikes, take downs, etc. The main objective is finding the correlation between different attributes that contribute to the win of the fight. We will find the main attributes by testing smaller subsets that present a higher precision for the model. Smaller experiments we would like to include in our project include trying to determine the weight class of the fighter without weight or height, like stance, number of punches, clinches, and kicks landed or attempted. The second side experiment is to determine if age is a factor of win rate by round length, number of rounds, wins by decision, KO, and significant strikes landed. The last experiment with this dataset is if winning and losing streaks such as a fighter with a higher win count on a losing streak would beat a lower win count fighter with a winning streak.
Our algorithm choices will be decided on data points due to that vase amount of attributes. We will test multiple available algorithms taught in class and online to reach the highest accuracy.
